## Solution Format

Each coding puzzle folder contains:
- **Solution file**: Implementation in Java, Python, or JavaScript.
- **test_cases.txt**: Test cases to validate the solution.
- Comprehensive documentation with:
  - Problem description and link
  - Algorithm explanation
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Detailed inline comments

## Features

- **Multiple Languages**: Solutions implemented in Java, Python, or JavaScript.
- **Test-Driven**: Each solution includes test cases for validation.
- **Well-Documented**: Detailed JavaDoc/docstring/JSDoc comments explaining approach.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity for each solution.
- **Organized Structure**: Problems categorized by platform and difficulty/level.
- **Standard Compliant**: Python code follows PEP-8 style guidelines with lowercase variable naming.
- **Automated Testing**: All solutions include test case reading functionality from test_cases.txt files.

## Usage

To run any solution:
1. Navigate to the specific problem folder with Puzzles as your source directory.
2. Compile and run the solution file:
   - **Java**: `javac FileName.java && java FileName`
   - **Python**: `python FileName.py`
   - **JavaScript**: `node FileName.js`
3. The program will automatically read test cases from `test_cases.txt`.
4. Results will be displayed for each test case.

## Platforms Covered
